# Murph Tracker for YAS
This site uses Gatsby and is hosted with GitHub Pages #thanks

## Adding new results
Results are pulled from date-named CSV files in the src/data directory
The date is parsed from the file name and should be in the YYYY-MM-DD.csv format
These files have the following format
| name        |    time     |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Alex E      | 00:50:00    |
| John D      | 01:20:22    |
